# Flashmachine

Flashmachine is a word list app.

Add up to 30 English or Korean words, and it will search for them, and return dictionary results.
Edit the results into usable definitions, and save the resulting file to your computer.
You can then import it into Anki!

### Getting Started

- Use `yarn` or `npm -i` to install the packages.
- Use `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the local dev version.
